## Current Status

TruffleRuby is progressing fast but is currently probably not ready for you to
try running your full Ruby application on. Support for critical C extensions
such as OpenSSL and Nokogiri is missing.

TruffleRuby is ready for experimentation and curious end-users to try on their
gems and smaller applications.

### Common questions about the status of TruffleRuby

#### Do you run Rails?

We do run Rails, and pass the majority of the Rails test suite. But we are
missing support for OpenSSL and Nokogiri which makes it not practical to run
real Rails applications at the moment.

#### What is happening with AOT, startup time, and the SubstrateVM?

Ahead-of-time compilation of the TruffleRuby interpreter, along with the Graal
compiler, is our proposed solution to the problem of startup time of a language
implemented in Java. The technology we are using to do this is called the
SubstrateVM. We hope to make the SubstrateVM available publicly at some point
soon.

#### Running on a standard JVM

It is possible to run today on an unmodified JDK 9 EA build, but at the moment
this requires building Graal yourself and we don't recommend end-users try it.
It will be supported when Java 9 is released.

#### Installing gems

TruffleRube cannot install gems out of the box yet, however there are 
[temporary workarounds](https://github.com/graalvm/truffleruby/tree/truffle-head/doc/user/installing-gems.md) 
which can be used to get it working. 

## Getting Started

The best way to get started with TruffleRuby is via the GraalVM, which includes
compatible versions of everything you need as well as TruffleRuby.

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oracle-labs/program-languages/

Inside the GraalVM is a `bin/ruby` command that runs TruffleRuby.
